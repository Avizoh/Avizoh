Hi! I'm Avizoh, I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Course at UTSA. As a young kid, I always had myself around technology.
I loved playing games which was what got me into computers and how the hardware in them worked. At 15, I built my first computer. I began playing
Minecraft on there, which I then got into private online servers. I created plugins for the server. At first, they were just simple text message 
addons. Later on, I create activities for them to do such as fishing with a custom item that has it's own reward system with custom configurable
rewards. During that time I was also taking computer science classes throughout my time in high school. Fast forward to now, I am branching out
to learn other frameworks, languages, and database related programs.

-- ðŸ‘€ A little bit about me ðŸ‘€ --
I took Computer Science all four years in high school focusing on Java
I have played soccer majority of my life
I love traveling, scenery, mountains, and beaches.
If I'm not out, I am at my computer.

-- ðŸŒ± What I'd like to get myself into ðŸŒ± --
I am currently learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
